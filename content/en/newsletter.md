## One email. One essential. Every week.

Looking for a **Swift newsletter** that saves you time and gives you the most important update of the week?  
**One Swift Thing** is for you.

Each week, I check the best Swift newsletters —covering Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, tools, productivity and more— and pick **just one article**. The one I think is most useful for Apple developers.

---

## 🧭 Why only one thing?

Because learning one thing every week is better than reading a lot once and then nothing for months.  
**One Swift Thing** is a simple **Swift newsletter** to help you keep learning without stress.

## 💡 What if I have more time?

I recommend subscribing to more Swift newsletters if you can. I do that too — there’s lots of great content out there.  
But if you don’t have time to read everything, or don’t want to decide what to read…  
That’s why I made this **Swift newsletter**.
