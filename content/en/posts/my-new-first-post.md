Hi! I am very happy today, because I have refactored my blog üòâ

This is not my first experience writing in my blog but, 2022 was a year with changes and new challenges in my working life so, I decided restart my blog to align it with what I am doing day by day.

For this reason, this is my first post, but only in this new version of my blog.

## About me
If I have to talk about me in a sentence, I like to say that I am a passionate about programming and tech world.

Nowadays, I work as iOS Developer at [Hiberus](http://www.hiberus.com), a global consultancy company founded in Spain, but growing quickly and opening new offices in places such as Berl√≠n, London, M√©xico DF or Miami.

But, my work experience have been mainly focused in IT. Besides programming, I have previous experience working as QA or DevOps engineer. 

Recently, because I'm a enthusiastic user of Apple products, I decided to learn Swift, and specialize in their ecosystem development. Not only for iOS devices, but for MacOS or the rest of Apple operating systems.

### My personal life
I was born in Valencia (Spain), where I live, at 80‚Äôs, the age of Spectrum, Atari and the first Sega's or Nintendo videoconsoles. So, I grow up and enjoyed play videogames with my Sega Megadrive, watch cartoons as He-man, Dragon Ball or Captain Tsubasa.

I'm the proud father of Lucas üë∂üèª, my 3 years son that became the home CEO, and the proud husband of Lorena, the best life companion that I could have. A wonderfull woman, with a special power to treat with the childhood (And with me üòÖ)

Nowadays, I spend my non-working hours with my family or my hobbies, such as: enjoying TV Series, watching Formula 1, reading or playing chess.

## Why I write in this blog
### Knowledge
The first reason (and the most important) is for learning.
I think that there are 3 levels of knowledge:
- 1st: When someone teach you something, or you learn it watching a video or reading a book
- 2nd: When you are able to do what you have learned
- 3rd: When you are able to teach someone what you know.

And, for this reason, write in a blog help me to learn teaching others.

### To help
The second one, is helping others what today I love: programming. I think that everybody‚Äôs like help others, and also, this my way to extend the help that I receive from others.

### Express my opinion
Another reason is, as iOS Developer, I need to have a deep understand about the Apple ecosystem so, this will be a place to organize my thoughts about the news, products, events as WWDC‚Ä¶ but ever focused in coding

### Practice english
And the last reason, (but no less important), practice to write tech documentation in English. My native language is Spanish, but globalization and remote working has opened a lot of opportunities. And English is today the key language for learn and work.
