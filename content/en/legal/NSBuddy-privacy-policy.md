**Effective date**: 2025-07-01

NSBuddy (“the App”) is a macOS application developed and maintained by Oscar Moreno Zamora (“the Developer”). This privacy policy describes how NSBuddy handles user data and what information may be collected when using the App.

---

## 1. Information Collected

NSBuddy is designed with privacy in mind. The App does **not** collect or transmit any personal data by default.

The following information may be collected or accessed locally:

- **App Version**: The App checks its version to determine when to prompt the user for an App Store review.
- **Email (Optional)**: Users may voluntarily provide their email address when submitting feedback via WishKit.
- **Access to Xcode Data**: Upon explicit user permission, NSBuddy accesses and manages the following directories to clean development artifacts:
  - `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
  - `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Previews`

---

## 2. Use of External Services

NSBuddy uses the following third-party services:

- **WishKit**: Used to collect optional user feedback.
- **RevenueCat**: Used to manage subscriptions and purchases. NSBuddy does not store or access any payment information directly.
- **External Links**: The App includes a “Browse” section with links to external resources. Internet access is only used to open those links in the default browser.

No other external communication or data transfer is performed by the App.

---

## 3. Data Storage

All data generated or used by NSBuddy is stored **locally** on the user’s device. No data is uploaded to any server controlled by the Developer.

---

## 4. Permissions

NSBuddy requests permission to access specific system directories necessary for its core functionality:

- `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
- `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Previews`

These permissions are only requested once and require explicit user approval.

---

## 5. Legal Compliance

NSBuddy is available globally. While the App does not process or store personal data in a way that typically triggers privacy regulations such as the GDPR, the Developer is committed to respecting user privacy and complying with applicable laws.

---

## 6. Subscriptions and Payments

NSBuddy offers subscription-based access to most of its features. Subscriptions are handled through **RevenueCat**, which integrates with Apple’s in-app purchase system. **No payment data** is collected or stored by the App or the Developer.
