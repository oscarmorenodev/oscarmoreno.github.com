QuizzySwift (“the App”) is an educational quiz game for iOS developed and maintained by Oscar Moreno Zamora (“the Developer”). This privacy policy describes how QuizzySwift handles user data and what information may be collected when using the App.

## 1. Information Collected

QuizzySwift is designed with privacy in mind. The App does **not** collect or transmit any personal data by default.

The following information may be collected or stored locally:

- **Game Progress**: The App stores user progress (e.g., answered questions, unlocked categories) locally on the device.
- **App Version**: Used to determine when to prompt the user for an App Store review.
- **Email (Optional)**: Users may voluntarily provide their email address when submitting feedback via WishKit.

---

## 2. Use of External Services

QuizzySwift uses the following third-party services:

- **WishKit**: Used to collect optional user feedback.
- **RevenueCat**: Used to manage subscriptions and purchases. QuizzySwift does not store or access any payment information directly.
- **External Links**: The App may include links to external learning resources. Internet access is only used to open those links in the default browser.

The App does not perform any other background network requests or data transfers.

## 3. Data Storage

All game-related data and user preferences are stored **locally** on the user’s device. No personal data is uploaded to any server controlled by the Developer.

---

## 4. Permissions

QuizzySwift does not require access to system directories or sensitive device permissions beyond those necessary for gameplay and subscription management.

---

## 5. Legal Compliance

QuizzySwift is available globally. While the App does not process or store personal data in a way that typically triggers privacy regulations such as the GDPR, the Developer is committed to respecting user privacy and complying with applicable laws.

---

## 6. Subscriptions and Payments

QuizzySwift offers optional subscription plans to unlock unlimited daily games and advanced features. These are handled through **RevenueCat**, which integrates with Apple’s in-app purchase system. **No payment data** is collected or stored by the App or the Developer.
