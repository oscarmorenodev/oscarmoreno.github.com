### My profesional life

If I have to talk about me in a sentence, I like to say that I am a passionate about programming and tech world.

I currently work as an iOS Developer at [Openbank](https://www.openbank.com), the online bank of [Grupo Santander](https://santander.com), which has apps used by millions of people across Europe and the Americas.

But, my work experience have been mainly focused in IT. Besides programming, I have previous experience working as QA or DevOps engineer.

Recently, because I'm a enthusiastic user of Apple products, I decided to learn Swift, and specialize in their ecosystem development. Not only for iOS devices, but for MacOS or the rest of Apple operating systems.

### My personal life

I was born in Valencia (Spain), where I live actually. and I was born at 80â€™s, the age of Spectrum, Atari and the first Sega's or Nintendo videoconsoles. So, I grow up and enjoyed play videogames with my Sega Megadrive, watch cartoons as He-man, Dragon Ball or Captain Tsubasa.

Iâ€™m the proud father of Lucas and Vega â€” the tiny royals who now run our home, and the husband of Lorena, the best life companion that I could have. A wonderfull woman, with a special power to treat with the childhood (And with me ðŸ˜…)

Nowadays, I spend my non-working hours with my family or my hobbies, such as: enjoying TV Series or watching Formula 1 races.
