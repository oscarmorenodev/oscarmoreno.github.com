### My profesional life
If I have to talk about me in a sentence, I like to say that I am a passionate about programming and tech world.

Nowadays, I work as iOS Developer at [Hiberus](http://www.hiberus.com), a global consultancy company founded in Spain, but growing quickly and opening new offices in places such as Berl√≠n, London, M√©xico DF or Miami.

But, my work experience have been mainly focused in IT. Besides programming, I have previous experience working as QA or DevOps engineer. 

Recently, because I'm a enthusiastic user of Apple products, I decided to learn Swift, and specialize in their ecosystem development. Not only for iOS devices, but for MacOS or the rest of Apple operating systems.

### My personal life
I was born in Valencia (Spain), where I live actually. and I was born at 80‚Äôs, the age of Spectrum, Atari and the first Sega's or Nintendo videoconsoles. So, I grow up and enjoyed play videogames with my Sega Megadrive, watch cartoons as He-man, Dragon Ball or Captain Tsubasa.

I'm the proud father of Lucas üë∂üèª, my 3 years son that became the home CEO, and the proud husband of Lorena, the best life companion that I could have. A wonderfull woman, with a special power to treat with the childhood (And with me üòÖ)

Nowadays, I spend my non-working hours with my family or my hobbies, such as: enjoying TV Series, playing chess or watching Formula 1 races.
